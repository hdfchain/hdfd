Package dcrutil provides hdfchain-specific convenience functions and types.
A comprehensive suite of tests is provided to ensure proper functionality.

This package was developed for hdfd, a full-node implementation of Decred which
is under active development by Company 0.  Although it was primarily written for
hdfd, this package has intentionally been designed so it can be used as a
standalone package for any projects needing the functionality provided.
