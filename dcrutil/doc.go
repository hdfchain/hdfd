/*
Package dcrutil provides decred-specific convenience functions and types.

Block Overview

A Block defines a Decred block that provides easier and more efficient
manipulation of raw wire protocol blocks.  It also memoizes hashes for the
block and its transactions on their first access so subsequent accesses don't
have to repeat the relatively expensive hashing operations.

Tx Overview

A Tx defines a Decred transaction that provides more efficient manipulation of
raw wire protocol transactions.  It memoizes the hash for the transaction on its
first access so subsequent accesses don't have to repeat the relatively
expensive hashing operations.

Address Overview

The Address interface provides an abstraction for a Decred address.  While the
most common type is a pay-to-pubkey-hash, Decred already supports others and
may well support more in the future.  This package currently provides
implementations for the pay-to-pubkey, pay-to-pubkey-hash, and
pay-to-script-hash address types.
