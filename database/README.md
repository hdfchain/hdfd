database
========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hdfchain/hdfd.png?branch=master)]
(https://travis-ci.org/hdfchain/hdfd)

Package database provides a block and metadata storage database.

Please note that this package is intended to enable hdfd to support different
database backends and is not something that a client can directly access as only
one entity can have the database open at a time (for most database backends),
and that entity will be hdfd.

When a client wants programmatic access to the data provided by hdfd, they'll
likely want to use the [dcrrpcclient](https://github.com/hdfchain/dcrrpcclient)
package which makes use of the [JSON-RPC API]
(https://github.com/hdfchain/hdfd/tree/master/docs/json_rpc_api.md).

However, this package could be extremely useful for any applications requiring
Hdfchain block storage capabilities.

The default backend, ffldb, has a strong focus on speed, efficiency, and
robustness.  It makes use of leveldb for the metadata, flat files for block
storage, and strict checksums in key areas to ensure data integrity.

## Feature Overview

- Key/value metadata store
- Hdfchain block storage
- Efficient retrieval of block headers and regions (transactions, scripts, etc)
- Read-only and read-write transactions with both manual and managed modes
- Nested buckets
- Iteration support including cursors with seek capability
- Supports registration of backend databases
- Comprehensive test coverage

## Installation

```bash
$ go get github.com/hdfchain/hdfd/database2
```

## Examples

* [Basic Usage Example]
  (http://godoc.org/github.com/hdfchain/hdfd/database2#example-package--BasicUsage)  
  Demonstrates creating a new database and using a managed read-write
  transaction to store and retrieve metadata.

* [Block Storage and Retrieval Example]
  (http://godoc.org/github.com/hdfchain/hdfd/database2#example-package--BlockStorageAndRetrieval)  
  Demonstrates creating a new database, using a managed read-write transaction
  to store a block, and then using a managed read-only transaction to fetch the
  block.
