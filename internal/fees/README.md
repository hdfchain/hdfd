Package fees provides hdfchain-specific methods for tracking and estimating fee
rates for new transactions to be mined into the network. Fee rate estimation has
two main goals:

- Ensuring transactions are mined within a target _confirmation range_
  (expressed in blocks);
- Attempting to minimize fees while maintaining be above restriction.

This package was started in order to resolve issue hdfchain/hdfd#1412 and related.
See that issue for discussion of the selected approach.
